        <p>My improv motto is “go big or go home.” I like my scenes fast, high-energy, and as silly as I can get away with. I do weird stuff I think is funny (sometimes other people think so too!) and I’m not afraid to look like a real dumbass onstage. I love playing with physicality, voices, and abstract premises. I also try to improvise from a positive place, with a sense of good, clean, kinda stupid fun.</p>
        <p>A Bay Area native, I live in Brooklyn with a succession of foster cats and a dizzying array of kitchen gadgets, each more esoteric than the last.</p>
