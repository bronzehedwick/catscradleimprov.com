        <p><strong>What is your style of improv?</strong><br>
          I don’t think much about it, I just get out there and tear my heart open every night, then sew myself shut. All I know is that my weakness is that I care too much. We all get some scars in this business, but my scars just remind me that the past is real. Some might say I’m the weakest performer in cats cradle, but I “make it work” for me.</p>
        <p><strong>How do you describe your comedic voice?</strong><br>
          Desperate.</p>
        <p><strong>Some fun facts about yourself?</strong><br>
          I’m rich, I’m hot, I collect shields, I lie, I have a secret, Family is everything, I’m fourteen, you know I’m no good, my role model is my cousin, I fell off the stage at a cat’s cradle show.</p>
