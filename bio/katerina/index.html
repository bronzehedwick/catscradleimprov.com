        <p>My style of improv is realistic, supportive, and quirky. My comedic voice is very quiet, and it has been suggested, more than once, that she should use a microphone.</p>
        <p>I’m originally from Greece, and spent most of my life in Florida, but love for public transportation and improv brought me to NYC a little over two years ago.</p>
        <p>I’ve been doing improv for over ten years, both in Florida and New York.</p>
        <p>When I’m not doing improv, I spend most of my time hanging out with my Beagle or talking about my Beagle.</p>
