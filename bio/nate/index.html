        <p>I’ve been improvising for over twelve years in many forms and styles, including puppet improv, musical improv, and improvised one-act plays. I love to make connections and call-backs to previous scenes as a way of bringing the set together, and prefer scenes with more than two people, because “Hey! More people equals more friends!”</p>
        <p>My comedic voice includes dad jokes, bad puns, taking everything literally, satirizing stupid rules and concepts, and taking about everything else besides whatever seems important.</p> 
        <p>I love watching characters get frustrated by never getting what they want. Also…ghosts, Draculas, werewolves, and frankensteins are hilarious. I can name all the states in alphabetical order and I’ve been poked in the eye by Ryan Seacrest.</p>
        <p>I’ve been told recently that I’m good at puzzles.</p>
