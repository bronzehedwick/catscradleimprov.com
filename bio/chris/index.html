        <p>Hi. Listen, alright? I'm telling you a story about me, Chris DeLuca, the improvisor. I've locked the doors. They're in my apartment, so it doesn't effect you, but I still want you to think about it.</p>
        <p>My improvisational style has been described as silly, featuring big doofy character work, combined with quick footed logic to tie everything together. Who made that description? Who cares! More importantly, who smells? Me? Wrong, I'm in my apartment, so I know you can't smell shit. You plinth weasle.</p>
        <p>My comedic voice is very gentle. Jesus.</p>
